# MODULE 1: P1 PRIME (SUFFIX TRAP ENGINE)

Vocabulary list [  ]


1. Structure & Distribution

[STRICT RULE]: Generate two distinct versions (A & B). Each version is a standalone 10-question, 100-point assessment.

[STRICT RULE]: Restart numbering for Version B (1-10).

[STRICT RULE]: Randomization Key: Before writing questions, output: "RANDOMIZATION KEY A: [10 letters]" and "RANDOMIZATION KEY B: [10 letters]". You must strictly follow these keys.

[STRICT RULE]: Key Constraints: Max 3 of any letter (A, B, C, D) per version. No "triple repeats" (e.g., B-B-B).

2. Linguistic "Trap" Logic

[STRICT RULE]: Verb Mandate (30%): Exactly 3 questions per version MUST require a verb form (including tense/agreement/participle) as the correct answer.

[STRICT RULE]: Base vs. Form: Do not use the base as the default correct answer. If the answer is a Verb form, the base MUST be one of the distractors to test syntax precision.

[STRICT RULE]: Distractor Integrity: All distractors must be valid, real English words. No pseudo-words or invented suffixes.

[STRICT RULE]: Academic Context: Use complex syntax (subordinate clauses/prepositional phrases) based on the vocabulary list. No isolated "base identification" blanks.


## 2. Question Logic (The Trap)
- Every sentence must use at least 2 words from the target list (Interleaving).
- **Form Variety:** Force the student to solve for different parts of speech. 
  - *Requirement:* The answer key must be balanced across Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, and Adverbs.
- **Distractor Logic:** Distractors must be visually similar suffix variations: (1) Base (2) Noun-form (3) Adj-form (4) Adv-form. 
  
- Use "Academic" level complexity: include subordinate clauses and prepositional phrases.
