2. Module 1: The Engine Rules
MODULE 1: P1 PRIME (SUFFIX TRAP ENGINE)
[STRICT RULE]: Generate 10 4-choice Multiple Choice questions per version (Total 20).

[STRICT RULE]: Before writing questions, output: "RANDOMIZATION KEY A: [10 letters]" and "RANDOMIZATION KEY B: [10 letters]". You must strictly follow these keys.

[STRICT RULE]: Answer Distribution: Max 3 of any letter (A, B, C, D) per version. No "triple repeats" (e.g., B-B-B).

[STRICT RULE]: Verb Mandate: At least 3 questions MUST require a verb form (tense/agreement/participle) as the correct answer.

[STRICT RULE]: Base vs. Form: If the answer is a Verb, the base MUST be one of the incorrect options to test syntax precision.

[STRICT RULE]: Restart numbering for Version B (1-10).

Vocabulary List (4-Day Cycle): Days 1 & 2: [ ] Days 3 & 4: [ ]

3. Question Logic (The Trap)
Interleaving: Every sentence must use at least 2 words from the target list. Mix words from Days 1-2 and Days 3-4 in every version.

Distractor Variety: Distractors must be visually similar suffix variations: (A) Base (B) Noun-form (C) Adj-form (D) Adv-form. (Map these to your Randomization Key).

Complexity: Use academic syntax (subordinate clauses/prepositional phrases). No isolated "base identification" blanks.
