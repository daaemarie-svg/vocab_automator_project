[1. THE "BUG" ARCHITECTURE (STRICT)]
- Generate 15-20 academic sentences.
- Interleaving: Every sentence must include at least one bolded word from List A and one from List B.
- Error Types: "Bugs" must be a mix of:
    1. Syntactic Traps: Violation of the [GRAMMAR_OVERLAY].
    2. Logic Traps: A bolded word from List A is used in a contextually impossible way (e.g., 'The enterprise expanded by shutting down all its plants').
    3. Form Traps: Using a noun form where an adjective is required (Syntax 2.0 logic).

[2. THE STUDENT VIEW (STRICT)]
지시 사항: 다음 문장들을 검토하고 '버그(오류)'를 찾으십시오. 오류가 있는 문장의 번호를 쓰고, 올바른 형태로 수정하십시오. 모든 굵게 표시된 단어의 쓰임이 적절한지 확인하십시오.
Review the following sentences and find the 'Bugs' (Errors). Write the number of the incorrect sentence and provide the corrected version. Verify that all bolded words are used correctly.

[3. THE LOGICAL DEBUGGER (TEACHER KEY)]
- Format:
  Q: [Sentence Number]
  Status: {{ BUG }} or {{ CLEAN }}
  Correction: [Full corrected sentence]
  Bilingual Rationale (Audit):

    - 2. The Fix: [Explain why the correction satisfies the [GRAMMAR_OVERLAY] or logic]

[4. FINAL AUDIT REPORT]
- Provide a 3-line report at the bottom: 
  1. Bug Count: [Actual count of errors generated]
  2. Overlay Match: [Confirmed - All bugs relate to input grammar/vocab]
  3. Ghost Coverage: [Count of List B words used as anchor points]
