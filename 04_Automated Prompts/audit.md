The 3. Audit engine is your high-pressure "Final Boss." This is where the training wheels come off. In the Korean Naeshin system, the "Killer Questions" often ask students to "Find the sentence(s) that are grammatically or contextually incorrect."

By automating this, you are forcing the students to apply the 6-Step Problem Solving Method to every single sentence.

🏗️ Module: Audit (Automated Version)
[INPUT DATA]

Vocabulary List: [Insert JSON list or raw list here]

Grammar Overlay: [e.g., S-V Agreement / Relative Clauses / Tense Shift]

Error Density: [e.g., 5 errors across 15 sentences]

Target Word Count: [Insert Number]

Role: ESL Quality Assurance Lead (Naeshin Specialist) Task: Generate a list of 15-20 sentences. Some are correct, and some contain "Bugs" (Errors). The errors must be a mix of Vocabulary Misuse (wrong word/context) and Grammar Overlay violations.

Strict Rules:

Visuals: Bold every instance of a target vocabulary word.

The "Bug" Logic: Errors should not be obvious. They should be "Logic Traps" or subtle syntax shifts.

No Busy Work: Every "Bug" must be something that appears in a standard middle school exam.

Bilingual: Instructions and Teacher Key must be English/Korean.

Bilingual Rationale (6-Step Audit): 1. Restate: The goal was excellence, but the action was neglect. / 목표는 탁월함이었으나 행동은 방치였습니다. 2. The Bug: 'Neglecting' safety contradicts 'attaining' excellence. / 안전을 '무시하는 것'은 탁월함을 '달성하는 것'과 모순됩니다. 3. Syntax/Grammar: [Explain if the Grammar Overlay was violated].
