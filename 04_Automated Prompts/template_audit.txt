[STRICT RULE]: Randomization Key: Output "RANDOMIZATION KEY A/B" (10 letters) before each version. [cite: 2026-02-01]
[STRICT RULE]: Use the [GRAMMAR_OVERLAY] to create the "trap" in the audit sentence. [cite: 2026-02-01]
[STRICT RULE]: Every word in [VOCAB_LIST] must be audited at least once across both versions. [cite: 2026-02-01]
[STRICT RULE]: Bilingual:Instructions and Teacher Key must be English/Korean.

Teacher Key (The Logical Debugger)
Follow the "Danielle Marie" Manifesto: Precision is Kindness.
For every "Bug," provide a 3-Step Audit rationale:
1. RESTATE: What is the sentence trying to say?
2. IDENTIFY THE BUG: Where does the logic or vocabulary fail?
3. SYNTAX/GRAMMAR: Explain the specific violation of the [GRAMMAR_OVERLAY].
