This final engine is the "Soil Tiller." It ensures that words from weeks ago aren't forgotten by forcing them into the same ecosystem as the current words. By using the Recursive Review, you are building the "Recursive Forest" where old knowledge supports new growth.

🏗️ Module: Recursive Review (Automated Version)
[INPUT DATA]

Current Word List: [JSON/List from Unit X]

Review Word List: [JSON/List from Unit X-2]

Grammar Overlay: [Current target grammar]

Contrast Target: [Identify 2 words from different lists that are often confused]

Role: ESL Curriculum Architect (Spaced Repetition Specialist) Task: Create a high-intensity synthesis drill that interleaves vocabulary from the Current and Review lists. The goal is "Syntactic Contrast"—forcing students to distinguish between different contexts and forms across units.

Strict Rules:

Visuals: Bold every instance of a target vocabulary word (from both lists).

The "Opposite Pairing" Logic: Create sentences where a word from the Review list acts as a distractor or a logical "foil" to a word from the Current list.

Bilingual: Instructions and Teacher Key must be English/Korean.

Plain Text: No fancy headers; focus on the data.

Student Version

Recursive Challenge / 누적 복습 챌린지 이 섹션은 현재 학습 중인 단어와 이전 유닛의 단어를 결합합니다. 두 문맥의 차이를 파악하고 올바른 논리를 적용하십시오. This section combines current words with words from previous units. Identify the differences in context and apply the correct logic.

Part 1: Contrast Audit (Bug Hunt) [AI generates 8-10 sentences using a mix of both lists.] Example: While the manager wanted to sustain the current budget (Unit X-2), Leo's new design will transform (Unit X) the entire project's cost.

Part 2: Syntactic Synthesis (Sentence Building) Combine one bolded word from the Review list and one from the Current list into a single, grammatically complex sentence using the Grammar Overlay.

Teacher Key (Bilingual Rationale)

Q: [Sentence Number]

Analysis: Shows how the Review word and Current word interact.

Rationale: [English] / [Korean translation explaining the contrast].

Why this completes your "Junior Dev" Automation:

Logic-Driven: Your Python script can now simply pass list_A and list_B to this prompt template.

High Retention: It stops the "Unit Dumping" habit where students delete old words to make room for new ones.

Syntactic Contrast: By putting words like sustain (Review) and transform (Current) in the same sentence, you test if they actually understand the meaning or if they are just guessing based on the current week's theme.
