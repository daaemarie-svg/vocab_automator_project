Strict Rules:

[STRICT RULE]: Generate exactly 10 questions for Version A and 10 questions for Version B. [cite: 2026-01-08]
[STRICT RULE]: Focus on "Context" logic: use high-level situational descriptions where only one specific word from the [VOCAB_LIST] fits semantically. [cite: 2026-02-01]
[STRICT RULE]: Distractors must be the same word class as the correct answer to ensure the test is about "meaning" (base) and nuance. [cite: 2026-01-27, 2026-02-01]
[STRICT RULE]: Randomization Key: Output "RANDOMIZATION KEY A/B" (10 letters) before each version. [cite: 2026-02-01]
[STRICT RULE]: Bilingual:Instructions and Teacher Key must be English/Korean.

No Busy Work: Every question must require "debugging" the logic or syntax of the text.
